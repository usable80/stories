   Uploading ad to google ad manager:
   1. Choose "Code Type" as "AMP", copy the entire content of index.html without formatting and paste it inside the "AMP HTML" textbox.
   2. Your local uploaded assets of the story ad have been downloaded as part of the zip and have a relative path in index.html, please upload those assets and change its file path by inserting macros. If you have used external assets, they would have direct external links in html.
